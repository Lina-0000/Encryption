# Encryption
This is a training project that includes the software implementation of the following ciphers:

-- Caesar cipher

A kind of substitution cipher in which each character of the encrypted text is replaced by a character standing N characters to the right in the alphabet. In this cipher, N is the key.

-- The method of encrypting tables with a single key permutation

One of the methods of encryption tables. The encryption table must contain the number of columns, how many letters the keyword contains. The encrypted text is written to the table as follows - first the first column is filled in, then the second, and so on, until the encrypted text ends. Then the columns of the table are rearranged according to how the letters of the keyword go in the alphabet. Reading the resulting table line by line, we get the encrypted text. 
Decryption is performed in reverse order.

-- Trithemius cipher

Implementation of the classical Trithemius cipher. 
But this particular implementation works only for the Russian language.
